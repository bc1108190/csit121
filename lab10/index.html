        <h4>What is JavaScript?</h4>
        <p>The JavaScript is a programming language. We use it to give instructions to the computer. <br>
            It is one of the world's most popular programming languages.</p>
        <h4>How is JavaScript related to HTML and CSS?</h4>
            <p>The fundamental building elements of web development are HTML, CSS, and JavaScript.<br>
             A web page's HTML provides the structure and content, CSS manages the layout and visual <br>
              styling, and JavaScript adds dynamic effects and interactivity. To develop a user <br>
              interface that is responsive and captivating, JavaScript works with HTML components <br>
              and CSS styles. With HTML serving as the framework, CSS giving visual appeal, and <br>
              JavaScript bringing the web page to life with dynamic functionality and effects, <br>
              they make a powerful trio.</p>
